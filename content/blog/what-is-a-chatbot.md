## Chatbot

A **chatbot** is an artificial intelligence (AI) software designed to interact with humans in their natural language. These interactions can occur through messaging applications, mobile apps, websites, or even through the telephone.

## How Do Chatbots Work?

Chatbots simulate human conversation by understanding and responding to text or voice inputs from users. They use Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies to understand user inputs and generate appropriate responses.

There are two types of chatbots:

1. **Rule-Based Chatbots**: These chatbots are programmed to respond to specific commands. They cannot understand inputs that deviate from these commands.

2. **AI-Based Chatbots**: These chatbots use AI, ML, and NLP to understand the context and intent of user inputs, allowing them to generate more natural and complex responses.

## How to Use Chatbots?

Chatbots can be used in various ways, including customer service, information retrieval, or even for entertainment. To interact with a chatbot, you simply input your query or command, and the chatbot will generate a response.
