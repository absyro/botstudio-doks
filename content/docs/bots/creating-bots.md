Creating a bot using Bot Studio is straightforward. You just need to fill in some basic configurations, and then you can create your bot. Here's how you can create a bot:

## Telegram Bot

1. Click on the "Create Bot" button on the sidebar of the dashboard page.
2. Select the Telegram platform and click on the "Next" button.
3. In the configuration form, enter a name for your bot (minimum of 2 letters).
4. Enter the token you've received from Telegram's [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).

To get a [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) token:

1. Open the Telegram app and send a message to [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Send the /newbot command and fill all required forms to create a bot.
3. After creating a bot, [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) will send you a message with your bot token. Use this token in Bot Studio's Telegram configuration.

## Discord Bot

1. Click on the "Create Bot" button on the sidebar of the dashboard page.
2. Select the Discord platform and click on the "Next" button.
3. In the configuration form, enter a name for your bot (minimum of 2 letters).
4. Enter the token you've received from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

To get a [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) token:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Create a new application and click on the "Bot" button on the sidebar.
3. Click on the "Reset Token" button and copy the new Discord token. Use this token to configure your bot.

## WhatsApp Bot

1. Click on the "Create Bot" button on the sidebar of the dashboard page.
2. Select the WhatsApp platform and click on the "Next" button.
3. In the configuration form, enter a name for your bot (minimum of 2 letters).
4. Scan the QR code using your WhatsApp account. Visit the [official WhatsApp website](https://faq.whatsapp.com/1317564962315842/?cms_platform=web) to learn how to scan a new QR code.

After filling in the configuration, read Bot Studio's "Terms & Conditions". If you agree with these terms, go to the next form and check the accuracy of the configuration. Then click on the "Create" button and wait for the process to finish.

If the bot was successfully created, you'll be redirected to the dashboard and be able to manage your bot from the "Bots" sub-menu. If you face any issues, you'll see a notification about the issue cause.
