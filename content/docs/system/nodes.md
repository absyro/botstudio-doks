Here, we make chatbot creation a breeze with visual scripting â€“ no coding required! Think of it as a puzzle, where each piece is a 'node'. Fit these nodes together, and voilÃ , you've got yourself a smart chatbot ready to converse!

#### Default Nodes

These are the all-rounders of nodes. No matter which chat platform you fancy â€“ WhatsApp, Telegram, or others â€“ these nodes fit right in, making your bot smart and responsive.

#### Platform Nodes

These are the specialists. For example, Telegram's "Send Message" node is perfect for Telegram bots, but it won't work for Discord. It's all about choosing the right tool for the job!

#### Sockets â€“ The Connectors

Every node comes with an "Action" socket, the magic connector that tells your chatbot what to do next. It's like a game of dominoes; one action leads to another!

And when you need to pass data around, say hello to the "JSON" socket! It's perfect for when your Python nodes need to share JSON goodies.

#### Node Executions â€“ The Magic Behind the Scenes

Nodes are more than meets the eye; they're the blueprints that our servers transform into chatbot magic.

When a node does its job right, the next one takes over, keeping the conversation flowing. But if something goes awry, it's either a full stop or just a hiccup, depending on the issue.

Some nodes are multitaskers with more than one action socket, giving you the power to steer the chat flow based on true or false outcomes. It's like a choose-your-own-adventure book!

And guess what? Some sockets are social butterflies, connecting to multiple nodes without a fuss â€“ except for JSON sockets; they prefer one-on-one chats.
